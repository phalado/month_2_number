# Month2Number

Welcome to Month 2 Number. A simple gem to parse different language month names into number, from 1 to 12, or burst (actually, just return nil otherwise).

We had 3 rules to create it:

- It should be simple
- It needed to be simple
- It had to be simple

I believe you will see that it's a simple code.

## Installation

The `gem_history` folder contains all gem versions to date. I recommend installing via Rubygems, but you can also download it and reference the path in your Gemfile.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add month_2_number

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install month_2_number

## Usage

It can't be simpler. The follow command will return a number from 1 to 12 or, in case it didn't find the month name, nil:

```ruby
Month2Number.parse(month_name)
```

When entering a month name, try to spell it correctly. However, you don't need to worry about special characters. For instance, both `d√©cembre` and `decembre` will be understood and return the value of 12. If you enter an incorrect or unrecognized month, the return value will be nil.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
